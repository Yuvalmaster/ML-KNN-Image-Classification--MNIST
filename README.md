# MNIST Image Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm
## Project Overview
This project aims to perform image classification on the MNIST dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with the Euclidean distance metric. 
The MNIST dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. 
The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify these digits based on the input images using the KNN algorithm.
